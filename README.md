# Memory Lens AI Hackathon Higgsfield 

This project explores the idea of 3D tracking based on barometric data combined with AR visualization.
Our goal is to develop a lightweight system that estimates the deviceâ€™s position and altitude using a barometer and motion sensors, and then displays it in 3D and augmented reality (AR) environments.

The concept can be applied to:

1)Indoor navigation (multi-floor positioning),

2)Rescue and emergency operations,

3)Sports and outdoor activities,

4)Robotics and drone applications.

By combining sensor data and AR visualization, we aim to create an intuitive and accurate way to represent spatial movement and height in real time.
